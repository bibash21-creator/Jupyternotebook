### Hello Everyone 

"""Today We are going to solve the problem related with swapping the 
variables value without using the temporary variable"""

"""So LET's GO"""

#Initialize two variables with values
x = 10
y = 12

"""We Will Use Python to solve this qn"""

x_swapped = y
y_swapped = x

"""Now the x_swapped will get values of y 
and the y_swapped will get values of x which results in swapped result"""

"""Let's see that"""

print("The value after swapping x with y is",x_swapped)
print("The value after swapping y with x is",y_swapped)

"""Now we will run the code in vs code using the extension code runner
"""
